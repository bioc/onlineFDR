Description: This package allows users to control the false discovery rate (FDR)
  or familywise error rate (FWER) for online multiple hypothesis testing, where
  hypotheses arrive in a stream. In this framework, a null hypothesis is
  rejected based on the evidence against it and on the previous rejection
  decisions.
